## Beautiful Strings

A string that can be constructed by concatenating two copies of the same string is called a beautiful string. 
The problem is to find the number of beautiful strings in the substrings of a string. A substring can be obtained by removing certain characters of a string provided that the relative order of the characters does not change.
